ECED3901 Project

This will be the greatest project Sexton Campus has ever seen in all it's years. It will make the entire Human Genome Project look like baby food. Strap your socks to your suspenders to make sure they are not blown off by this masterpiece.

All information in this repository is proprietary and lawsuits will be pursued aggressively. We will make it our mission to make sure your grandkid's grandkids pay for real or perceived discretions against this legendary project.
